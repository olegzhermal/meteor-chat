# To run the project in dev mode install meteor

# Premises made:
1) MongoDB from Meteor library is used (no connection to existing Mongo server).
2) Auth immitation (simple useState) with name as the only credentials.
3) No design.
4) No tests cover.
5) Think it's enought for the test assignment )))
